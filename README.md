> [!IMPORTANT] 
> injeqtor does not perform an in-depth SQL injection attack, it only checks whether SQL Injection is vulnerable and tries to find the name of the database. If you want to carry out an attack to obtain more information, I recommend using [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap).
